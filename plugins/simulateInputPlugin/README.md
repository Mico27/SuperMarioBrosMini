# GBS-simulateInputPlugin
 Plugin to simulate inputs

How to use:
To start simulating inputs, put a "start simulated inputs" event
In the event you can specify buttons to cancel the simulation
To add inputs to simulate, add "Set simulated input" events and wait events
At the end of the events you can add events that you want to run when the simulated inputs are completed or cancelled
